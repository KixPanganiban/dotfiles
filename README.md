# KixPanganiban's Dotfiles
My customized dotfiles! 

## Requirements
- ruby (to install homebrew if it's not installed)
- git

## To Install
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:kixpanganiban/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
$ cd .dotfiles; ./install.sh
```

- This installs/uses neovim, with dein as package manager
- This also uses tmux with tpm as package manager

## Other (non-dotfile) Packages

Here are some packages I also use that I decided not to include in the installation script:

- https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
- https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes
- https://github.com/caiogondim/bullet-train-oh-my-zsh-theme
- https://github.com/caiogondim/maglev
